## âœ¨ About me

Hi, I'm Honoka Noguchi! 
Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer who enjoys building user-friendly interfaces and making products easier to use. Iâ€™ve worked with technologies like React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Python, and Iâ€™m comfortable handling both front-end and back-end tasks. 
My background in the fintech industry taught me how to understand both user needs and business goals, and Iâ€™m excited to keep growing as an engineer and contribute to meaningful projects.

## âœ¨ Things I made

### Mugi.pet

Mugi is a bilingual platform that helps pet owners find and book trusted local pet sitters, ensuring a seamless and flexible experience. I participated in the project as a Full Stack Engineer.
